- A login to the Rock SQL database
- Your old database in a supported format
- Excavator files( see below for download )

## Downloads

## What If I Have A Problem?
- If you have a problem with the import, please file an issue on Github: [Excavator Issues](https://github.com/NewSpring/Excavator/issues)
- Please include the type of import (F1 or CSV) in the title and your Windows environment settings in the body.

<b>Extending/Adding other database models:</b>

<i>Simple version:</i><br>
1.  Download the zipped copy of Excavator from GitHub and rewrite the Excavator.Example project<br>
2.  Build or copy the compiled library (Excavator.Example.dll) to Excavator\bin<br>
3.  Run Excavator and select your new database component from the list on the first page<br>

<i>Advanced version:</i><br>
1.  Download the zipped copy of Excavator from GitHub <br>
2.  Add a new Class Library that extends the base ExcavatorComponent class<br>
3.  Add a reference to Excavator (from Solutions\Projects)<br>
4.  Add references to the packages inside Excavator\packages\Embeds and set their "Copy Local" property to false.*<br>
5.  Set the FullName of your specific database model <br>
6.  Implement the LoadSchema method (a template already exists for MDF files)<br>
7.  Implement the TransformData method inside your new ExcavatorComponent<br>
8.  Build or copy the compiled library (.dll) to Excavator\bin<br>
9.  Run Excavator and select your new database component from the list on the first page<br>

\*  All the packages in Excavator\packages\Embeds are included in Excavator.exe. If you use additional references, set "Copy Local" to true.  You will need to add the Costura.Fody (Nuget Package) to your project to make sure the references get compiled inside your DLL.
